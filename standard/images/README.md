# Diagrams

Diagram `.png` files are editable and managed using [diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net).

For maximum flexibility, save diagrams as PNG files (File -> Export as -> PNG), and ensure
that "Include a copy of my diagram" is checked (then saving the file with a `.png` extension).

For those who have diagrams.net installed, the resulting `.png` file will open for editing.  Else,
by default, the diagram will open as a normal PNG image for viewing (the first tab is displayed).
