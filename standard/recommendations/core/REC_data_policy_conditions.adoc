^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/core/data_policy_conditions*
^|A |A WCMP record's `+properties.wmo:dataPolicy.additionalConditions+` SHOULD provide more provider-specific context to the conditions by adding an external URL in a `+properties.wmo:dataPolicy.additionalConditions.link+` object.
^|B |The `+properties.wmo:dataPolicy.additionalConditions.scheme+` property SHOULD be used for conditions which are based on a codelist of controlled vocabulary.
^|C |A WCMP record's `+properties.wmo:dataPolicy.additionalConditions+` SHOULD contain a `+properties.wmo:dataPolicy.additionalConditions.link.title+` property to provide additional human-readable information about the external URL.
