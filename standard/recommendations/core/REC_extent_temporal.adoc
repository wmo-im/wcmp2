^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/core/extent_temporal*
^|A |For datasets with known or discrete intervals, a WCMP record SHOULD provide the temporal resolution (`+time.resolution+`) as a valid ISO 8601 duration (for example, `+P1D+`).
^|B |For complex temporal extents, a WCMP record SHOULD also provide a human-readable explanation in `+properties.description+` to promote clarification and unambiguity.
^|C |To distinguish maintenance or update frequency, those SHOULD be included in `+properties.themes+`.
