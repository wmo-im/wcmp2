^|A |A WCMP record SHOULD provide a high level description of a dataset to facilitate simple information search queries.
^|B |A WCMP record SHOULD provide enough information to facilitate further interaction with a dataset (parameters, variables, spatiotemporal dimensions) as part of an associated service or capability.
^|C |A WCMP record SHOULD describe dataset parameters and variables as themes/concepts with an associated vocabulary <<themes>>.
^|C |When  dataset properties (parameters, variables, spatiotemporal extents) are made available via a data service or API, a WCMP record SHOULD provide templated links to facilitate easier data queries and filtering. See the <<distribution>> section.
