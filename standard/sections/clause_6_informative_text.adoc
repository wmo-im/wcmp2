== Introduction

=== Overview

The initial WIS Technical Specifications were developed using service-oriented architecture (SOA) principles.  It featured
complex ISO 19115/19139-based XML for metadata. Since that time, authoritative
groups such as W3C and OGC have moved to adopt a more resource-oriented architecture (ROA), leveraging RESTful design
patterns as well as mass market encodings such as JSON and HTML.

Aligning with the WIS 2.0 Principles, in order to support the WIS 2.0 Technical Specifications for discovery and search,
discovery metadata will be published to a global discovery catalogue, which will provide an OGC API - Records searchable
functionality.  Users will be able to search from a web browser, whereas machines will interact with an API.

==== WIS 2.0

WIS 2.0 puts forth the following principles (those focused on discovery metadata are in **bold**):

* *Principle 1: WIS 2.0 adopts Web technologies and leverages industry best practices and open standards*
* *Principle 2: WIS 2.0 uses Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to identify resources*
* *Principle 3: WIS 2.0 prioritizes use of public telecommunications networks (i.e. Internet) when publishing digital resources*
* *Principle 4: WIS2.0 requires provision of Web service(s) to access or interact with digital resources (e.g. data, information, products) published using WIS*
* Principle 5: WIS 2.0 encourages NCs and DCPCs to provide 'data reduction' services via WIS that process 'big data' to create results or products that are small enough to be conveniently downloaded and used by those with minimal technical infrastructure
* *Principle 6: WIS 2.0 will add open standard messaging protocols that use the publish-subscribe message pattern to the list of data exchange mechanisms approved for use within WIS and GTS*
* Principle 7: WIS 2.0 will require all services that provide real-time distribution of messages to cache/store the messages for a minimum of 24 hours, and allow users to request cached messages for download
* Principle 8: WIS 2.0 will adopt direct data exchange between provider and consumer
* Principle 9: WIS 2.0 will phase out the use of routing tables and bulletin headers
* *Principle 10: WIS 2.0 will provide a Catalogue containing metadata that describes both data and the service(s) provided to access that data*
* *Principle 11: WIS 2.0 encourages data providers to publish metadata describing their data and Web services in a way that can be indexed by commercial search engines*

==== Discovery metadata design considerations

The following describes envisioned workflows of WIS 2.0 in the context of metadata search and harvesting.

We consider the following:

* flexible metadata publishing mechanisms: providers need to be able to publish discovery metadata in the easiest and
most efficient way possible
* basic, HTTPS crawlable metadata files (filesystem, object storage). For example, publishing discovery metadata as
JSON files to an S3 bucket, and then making that bucket available for harvesting and traversal to search engines and
metadata harvesters
* the browser as the catalogue: here, browsers utilize mass market search engines as the gateway to low barrier
discovery.  This pattern may work by way of the Global Discovery Catalogue and the Global Cache, with the idea that
search engines can index from the authoritative source

==== Granularity

In order to provide discovery metadata of value, it is important to clarify the granularity levels of which providers
are to provide describing their data/services.  Articulating granularity will reduce catalogue "pollution"
and bring the user closer to the data via their search criteria.

The <<metadata-discovery-workflow>> below illustrates example metadata publiciation and discovery workflows against
common meteorological data types:

Common meteorological data types include:

* collection (model): NWP model (discovery metadata record).  Example: Canadian Global Deterministic Prediction System
** collection (variable): NWP model output by forecast variable (including vertical levels) (child discovery metadata record).
   Example: Canada GDPS air temperature
** access options:
*** API endpoint to interrogate the data/variable
*** x/y/z/t (granule) (STAC Item with link to actual data asset)

* collection (observations): surface weather observations (discovery metadata record)
** station metadata as WIGOS metadata via WMO OSCAR/Surface
** access options:
*** API endpoint to interrogate the data
*** x/y/z/t (granule) (STAC Item, with link to actual data asset)

* collection (climate archive): climate daily station data (discovery metadata record)
** access options:
*** API endpoint to interrogate the data
*** single observation (granule) (STAC Item with link to actual data asset)

=== User stories

As part of requirements gathering footnote:[https://github.com/wmo-im/wcmp/issues/107], the following user stories provide a
description of features that are relevant to WIS 2.0 metadata and search, and are cast from a user perspective:

* As an NWP center operator I want to quickly and easily publish information about the data that my centre provides and update it as needed in a (semi)automated way using the information that I already have in my vast databases so that I can concentrate on my core business
* As the leader of a forecasting team of a national meteorological institution, I would like to be able to find more sources of data that might be relevant/useful for the work of my team, notably NWP and satellite imagery so that we could further improve our predictions. That should work for unprocessed outputs of a prediction model or a satellite as well as for services that offer more sophisticated access to the data, e.g. tailing
* As an entrepreneur (start-up) that provides (wants to provide) tailored weather information I want to be able to find services (free or commercial) that provide meteorological data in a cloud or even better, provide customizable processing of such data - to be able to build my own service on top of it. And I want to be able to find out if a new such service appears or if an existing one changes its abilities so that my company can keep on advancing
* As a software developer (working for a national meteorological centre or a private company), I would like to find a relevant technical description of the service (API) that my boss wants me to integrate with, so that the declared interoperability becomes reality
* As a user I would like to search for real-time observations for a given time and geographical area of interest so that I can have up to date information on weather for my city
* As a web developer I would like to access to a search API that provides easy to read documentation, examples and a simple, intuitive RESTful API with JSON so that I can integrate into my web application quickly
* As a GIS professional, I would like to search for weather/climate/water data from my GIS Desktop support tool so that I can integrate forecast data into my workflow

The following WIS 2.0 marketing video footnote:[https://gisc.dwd.de/wis2.0/WIS_2.0_final.mp4] adds the following user stories:

* As an everyday user, I would like to find easy to understand and precise weather data so that I can plan to have people over for an outdoor BBQ on a nice day
* As a smart home owner, I would like access to frequently updated data so that I can keep my smart home monitoring up to date
* As a weather specialist, I would like to access weather data in native data formats and subscribe to data updates, so that I can provide tailor made weather services to my users

Given the above, we see a variety of users/actors to which WIS 2.0, driving the need for low barrier, ubiquitous and
efficient discovery, visualization, access of weather/climate/water (real-time, near real-time, archive, etc.) data.

=== OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core

The OGC Records - API - Part 1: Core specification:

* lowers the discovery barrier to finding the existence of geospatial resources on the Web
* provides the ability for discovery metadata to be published via API machinery or static records
* provides a core record model information communities to extend
* provides a subset of core queryables (e.g. by resource type, by external identifier) which enables
  federation and cross catalogue discovery functionality

=== The WIS 2.0 Global Discovery Catalogue

The GDC will provide a central search endpoint, enabling users to traverse, browse and search
data holdings in WIS 2.0.  Key search predicate capabilities include:

* geospatial
* temporal (time instant or time period)
* equality predicates (i.e. `+property=value+`).
* full-text (`+q=+`)

Given the WIS 2.0 principles, use cases, OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core, and the WIS 2.0 Global Discovery
Catalogue, WCMP provides a standards-based, clear and well-defined information model to facilitate the
management and discovery of data within WIS 2.0.
