== Scope

This document defines the content, structure, and encoding of discovery metadata published
as part of a WIS 2.0 catalogue.

The metadata standard defined herein is an informal extension of the International Standard
OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core.  This metadata standard shall be referred to as the WMO
Core Metadata Profile (WCMP).

WCMP discovery metadata records shall be encoded as GeoJSON as defined in OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core,
and can represent a number of different resources, including:

* data (NWP model output, observation collections)
* data APIs and data reduction services
* processes (analytics, etc.)

This specification defines the conformance requirements for the WMO Core Metadata
Profile.  Annex A defines the abstract test suite. Annex B provides normative information
on codelists.
