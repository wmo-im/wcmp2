== Scope

This document defines the content, structure, and encoding of discovery metadata published
as part of a WIS 2.0 catalogue.

The metadata standard defined herein is an informal extension of the International Standard
OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core.  This metadata standard shall be referred to as the WMO
Core Metadata Profile (WCMP).

WCMP discovery metadata records shall be encoded as GeoJSON as defined in OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core,
and can represent a number of different resources, including:

* data (NWP model output, observation collections)
* data APIs and data reduction services
* processes (analytics, etc.)

WCMP discovery metadata provides description at the granularity level of a dataset.  Station, instrument
and observation metadata are supported as part of the WIGOS Metadata Standard footnote:[https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=10109].

This specification defines the conformance requirements for the WMO Core Metadata
Profile.  Annex A defines the abstract test suite. Annex B provides normative information
on codelists.
