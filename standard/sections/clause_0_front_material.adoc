[big]*i.     Abstract*

Discovery and search is a key component to WIS 2.0.  Providing quality discovery metadata leveraging industry
standards, best practices and architecture helps lower the barrier to and extend the reach of weather, climate,
and water data.

This document defines the content, structure and encoding for the WMO Core Metadata Profile (WCMP).  This standard is
defined as an informal profile/extension of the OGC API - Records Standard footnote:[https://ogcapi.ogc.org/records].

WCMP documents provide descriptive information for discovery of WMO resources.  WMO resources include, but are not
limited to, data (NWP models, observations, forecasts and warnings, etc.), services/APIs, and processes.

WCMP documents shall be encoded in GeoJSON (RFC 7946 footnote:[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946]) as
defined this specification, and shall be made available as HTTP crawlable files, or via API provisioning as defined
by OGC API - Records.

Weather/climate/water data is by nature geospatial, and temporal.  The W3C Data on the Web Best
Practices footnote:[https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp] and Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices footnote:[https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp]
provide guidelines on how to best enable spatiotemporal data to lower the barrier for users, search engine optimization
and linked data.  This also aligns with the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
Reusable) footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data].
