== Cataloguing considerations

In addition to documenting and describing WIS2 data holdings, WCMP discovery metadata will be
searchable via the <<_the_wis2_global_discovery_catalogue>> (GDC).  As part of discovery and search
workflow, a GDC may choose to apply filters to help narrow search results.  This is realized by
the API of the GDC, as well as applying facets in the catalogue.

=== Faceting

The API of the GDC, in addition to allowing for spatial/temporal/attribute queries and filters,
may choose to apply facets to WCMP records.  Facets are effective when applied against controlled
vocabularies and classifications.  The following WCMP required properties would be subject to faceting by a GDC:

- ``centre-id`` as defined in <<_identifier>>
- <<_properties_type>>
- <<_properties_wmo_data_policy>>
