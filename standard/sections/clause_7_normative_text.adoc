== The WMO Core Metadata Profile Record

A WCMP record provides descriptive information about a dataset made available
through WIS 2.0.

=== Conformance Class Core

The WCMP Core Conformance Class provides requirements to articulate the required elements
of a WCMP discovery metadata record.

include::../requirements/requirements_class_core.adoc[]

==== Validation

The WCMP record schema is based on the schema defined as part of OGC API - Records - Part 1:
Core: Requirements Class: Record Core and the associated information model.  WCMP records which
are valid to WCMP are therefore valid to the OGC API - Records record schema.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_validation.adoc[]

==== Identifier

A WCMP record utilizes the OARec `+id+` property to provide a unique identifier
to a dataset collection.  A record identifier is essential for querying and identifying
records within the GDC.

[source,json]
----
"id": urn:x-wmo:md:ca.gc.ec.msc:observations.swob"
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_identifier.adoc[]

==== Conformance

A WCMP record leverages the OGC API `+conformsTo+` property to identify the conformance classes
that apply to the record.  WCMP conformance identification is valuable for content/version
detection and handling.

[source,json]
----
"conformsTo": [
  "http://wis.wmo.int/spec/wcmp/2.0"
]
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_conformance.adoc[]

==== Type

WCMP records provide descriptive information about a number of different resource types, such as
dataset or services.

[source,json]
----
"type": "dataset"
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_type.adoc[]

==== Title

A WCMP record's `+properties.title+` property is a human-readable name for a given dataset collection.

[source,json]
----
"title": "Surface weather observations"
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_title.adoc[]

==== Description

A WCMP record has a `+properties.description+` property, which is a free-text summary description of the
resource the provider wishes to make discoverable.

[source,json]
----
"description": "Surface observations measured at the automatic and manual stations of the Environment and Climate Change Canada and partners networks, either for a single station, or for the stations of specific provinces and territories (last 30 days)"
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_description.adoc[]

==== Keywords

A WCMP record can have has a `+properties.keywords+` property, typically represented using keywords, tags, key
phrases, or classification codes.

[source,json]
----
"keywords": [
  "surface",
  "observations",
  "weather",
  "real-time"
]
----

include::../recommendations/core/REC_keywords.adoc[]

==== Themes and Topic Hierarchy

A WCMP record has a `+properties.themes+` property, which is a knowledge organization system used to classify
the data that the record is describing.  A WCMP can have one or more themes.  The WIS Topic Hierarchy is put
forth as a specific theme/concept.

[source,json]
----
"themes": [
  {
    "concepts": [
      "weather"
    ],
    "scheme": "https://github.com/wmo-im/wcmp2-codelists/blob/main/codelists/earth-system-domain.csv"
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_themes_topic_hierarchy.adoc[]

==== Geospatial Extent

A WCMP record has a `+properties.extent.spatial.bbox+` item property, which provides the ability to list 1..n 
minimum bounding geometries for a given dataset collection, where:

* minx: westernmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in longitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -180 and 180, less than or equal to maxx
* miny: southernmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in latitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -90 and 90, less than or equal to maxy
* maxx: easternmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in longitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -180 and 180, greater than or equal to minx
* maxy: northernmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in latitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -90 and 90, greater than or equal to miny

This property also facilitates catalogue searches with spatial predicate (within extent, etc.).

==== Temporal Extent

A WCMP record has a `+properties.extent.temporal+` item property, which provides the ability to list 1..n
temporal extents as time instants or time periods.  Temporal extents can be fully bound or open in either direction
(e.g. until or before.  A temporal definition also includes resolution to be able express the granularity to
which a given dataset's data is measured/generated/reported.

==== Data Policy - License

Based on the WMO Unified Data Policy Resolution (Res.1) footnote:[https://ane4bf-datap1.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wmocms/s3fs-public/ckeditor/files/Cg-Ext2021-d04-1-WMO-UNIFIED-POLICY-FOR-THE-INTERNATIONAL-approved_en_0.pdf?4pv38FtU6R4fDNtwqOxjBCndLIfntWeR] (TODO: change to more permanent URL?), exchanged data
is expressed as `+core+` or `+recommended+`.  Additionally, `+other+` shall be used to accommodate other regulations
(e.g. ICAO Annex 3 â€“ Meteorological Services for International Air Navigation). To avoid uncertainty, where there
are no limitations, the category `+NoLimitation+` can be used. (TODO: can this be license: null)?

[horizontal]
_Note_:: 
1. _Further information on the description of data policy is provided in the Guide to the WMO Information System (WMO-No. 1061) footnote:[https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=10257]
2. _The WIS 2.0 Global Cache will only cache data classified as `+core+`.  Data classified as `+recommended+` and `+other+` will
not be cached by the Global Cache.  They will be provided directly by WIS 2.0 Nodes, eventually having further conditions._

WMO data policy is considered to be a *legal constraint applying to both usage and access*.

If additional licenses apply, data providers can use the value `+various+`, and articulate the various
licenses in the `+links+` property.

TODO: add example

include::../requirements/core/REQ_data_policy_license.adoc[]
include::../recommendations/core/REC_data_policy_license.adoc[]
include::../recommendations/core/PER_data_policy_license.adoc[]

==== Data Policy - Rights

A WCMP record has a `+properties.rights+` property, providing a statement that concerns all rights not addressed
by the license such as a copyright statement.

TODO: add example

include::../recommendations/core/REC_data_policy_rights.adoc[]

==== Distribution Information

===== Overview

A WCMP record provides information regarding how to access and retrieve data and products. This information is specified by defining a `+links+` array property, with one or more objects to corresponding data access services.
