== The WMO Core Metadata Profile Record

A WCMP record provides descriptive information about a dataset made available
through WIS 2.0.

=== Conformance Class Core

The WCMP Core Conformance Class provides requirements to articulate the required elements
of a WCMP discovery metadata record.

include::../requirements/requirements_class_core.adoc[]

==== Validation

The WCMP record schema is based on the schema defined as part of OGC API - Records - Part 1:
Core: Requirements Class: Record Core and the associated information model.  WCMP records which
are valid to WCMP are therefore valid to the OGC API - Records record schema.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_validation.adoc[]

==== Granularity

A WCMP record provides a description at the granularity of a dataset, which facilitates clearer
cataloguing and discovery workflow, in combination with data services or APIs, which provide
access/query/filter at a lower level of granularity (parameter, variable, spatiotemporal extents).

      "Dewpoint temperature"
    ],
    "scheme": "http://codes.wmo.int/bufr4/b"
----

include::../recommendations/core/REQ_granularity.adoc[]

==== Identifier

A WCMP record utilizes the OARec `+id+` property to provide a unique identifier
to a dataset.  A record identifier is essential for querying and identifying
records within the GDC.

[source,json]
----
"id": "urn:x-wmo:md:ca.gc.ec.msc:observations.swob"
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_identifier.adoc[]

==== Conformance

A WCMP record leverages the OGC API `+conformsTo+` property to identify the conformance classes
that apply to the record.  WCMP conformance identification is valuable for content/version
detection and handling.

[source,json]
----
"conformsTo": [
  "http://wis.wmo.int/spec/wcmp/2.0"
]
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_conformance.adoc[]

==== Properties Type

WCMP records provide descriptive information about a number of different resource types, such as
dataset or services.

[source,json]
----
"type": "dataset"
----

TODO: create and refer to WCMP2 codelist?

include::../requirements/core/REQ_type.adoc[]

==== Title

A WCMP record's `+properties.title+` property is a human-readable name for a given dataset.

[source,json]
----
"title": "Surface weather observations"
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_title.adoc[]

==== Description

A WCMP record has a `+properties.description+` property, which is a free-text summary description of the
resource the provider wishes to make discoverable.

[source,json]
----
"description": "Surface observations measured at the automatic and manual stations of the Environment and Climate Change Canada and partners networks, either for a single station, or for the stations of specific provinces and territories (last 30 days)"
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_description.adoc[]

==== Keywords

A WCMP record should have a `+properties.keywords+` property, typically represented using keywords, tags, key
phrases, or classification codes.

[source,json]
----
"keywords": [
  "surface",
  "observations",
  "weather",
  "real-time"
]
----

include::../recommendations/core/REC_keywords.adoc[]

==== Themes and Topic Hierarchy [[themes]]

A WCMP record has a `+properties.themes+` property, which is a knowledge organization system used to classify
the data that the record is describing.  A WCMP can have one or more themes.  The WIS 2 Topic Hierarchy is put
forth as a specific theme/concept, and is consistent with the topic as defined in distribution links
advertising broker services.

[source,json]
----
"themes": [
  {
    "concepts": [
      "weather"
    ],
    "scheme": "https://github.com/wmo-im/wcmp2-codelists/blob/main/codelists/earth-system-domain.csv"
----

[source,json]

----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_themes_topic_hierarchy.adoc[]

==== Geospatial and Temporal Extents

===== Geospatial Extent

WCMP records provide descriptive information regarding the geospatial properties of a dataset.  Geospatial
extents provide a useful indicator of the location of the dataset and facilitates searching the
Global Discovery Catalogue with geospatial predicates.

[source,json]
----
"geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [[
            [-142.23, 28.03],
            [-142.23, 82.56],
            [-52.16, 82.56],
            [-52.16, 28.03],
            [-142.23, 28.03]
    ]]
}
----

[source,json]
----
"geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-79.38, 43.65]
}
----

[source,json]
----
"geometry": null
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_extent_geospatial.adoc[]
include::../recommendations/core/REC_extent_geospatial_point.adoc[]
include::../recommendations/core/REC_extent_geospatial_precision.adoc[]

===== Additional Geospatial Extents

A WCMP record is able to communicate additional extents (for example, for non-geographic data, or multiple
temporal extents) via the `+properties.extent+` property.  The `+properties.extent.spatial.bbox+` property
provides the ability to list 1..n minimum bounding geometries for a given dataset, where:

* minx: westernmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in longitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -180 and 180, less than or equal to maxx
* miny: southernmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in latitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -90 and 90, less than or equal to maxy
* maxx: easternmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in longitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -180 and 180, greater than or equal to minx
* maxy: northernmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in latitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -90 and 90, greater than or equal to miny

This property also facilitates catalogue searches with geospatial predicate (within extent, etc.).

  }
}
----

include::../recommendations/core/PER_extent_geospatial.adoc[]

====== Temporal Extent

WCMP records provide descriptive information regarding the temporal properties of a dataset.  Temporal
extents provide a useful indicator of the date/time period of the dataset and facilitates searching the
Global Discovery Catalogue with temporal predicates.

"time": null
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_extent_temporal.adoc[]
include::../recommendations/core/REC_extent_temporal.adoc[]

===== Additional Temporal Extents

A WCMP record is able to communicate additional time instants or periods via the `+properties.extent.temporal+` item property.
Temporal extents can be fully bound or open in either direction (e.g. until or before.  A `+properties.extent.temporal.resolution+`
property is able express the temporal granularity at which a given dataset's data is measured/generated/reported.

[source,json]
----
"extent": {
  "temporal": {
    "interval": [
      [
        "1924-08-18",

    ],
    "resolution": "P1H",
    "trs": "http://www.opengis.net/def/uom/ISO-8601/0/Gregorian"
  }
}
----

include::../recommendations/core/PER_extent_temporal.adoc[]

==== Providers

A WCMP record has one or more providers listed as part of the `+properties.providers+` property. These elements
provide contact information based on the role of the provider.

==== Version

Datasets can typically be versioned by an organization (version of an NWP model, processing chain/workflow, etc.).  Data
providers may choose to make this information available to the user when providing multiple versions of a dataset
over time.

==== WMO Data Policy

Based on the WMO Unified Data Policy for the International Exchange of Earth System Data (Resolution 1 (Cg-Ext(2021) footnote:[https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=11113#page=9], exchanged data are classified as `+core+` or `+recommended+`.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_data_policy.adoc[]

If the resource is classified as `+recommended+`, it needs to be indicated if any additional conditions apply.  Conditions on use are essential for the WMO Unified Data Policy, but for transparency and clarification any other conditions should also be indicated.

==== Distribution Information [[distribution]]

===== Overview

A WCMP record provides information regarding how to access and retrieve data and products.  This information is specified by defining a `+links+` array property, with one or more objects to corresponding data access services.

===== Examples

- *_Adding the MQTT information_*

Below is an example of two link objects, providing both search and MQTT subscription information:
