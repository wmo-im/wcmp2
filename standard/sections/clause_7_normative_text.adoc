==== Validation

The WCMP record schema is based on  _OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core: Requirements Class: Record Core_ schema and the associated information model.  WCMP records compliant with WCMP schema are therefore compliant with the _OGC API - Records_ record schema.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_validation.adoc[]

==== Identifier

The `+id+` property is a unique identifier
of the dataset.  A record identifier is essential for querying and identifying
records within the GDC.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_identifier.adoc[]

.Example

[source,json]
----
"id": "urn:x-wmo:md:can:eccc-msc:observations.swob"
----

==== Conformance

The `+conformsTo+` property to identifies the version ofthe WCMP standard that the metadata record conforms to. Conformance identification is valuable for version
detection and handling of content.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_conformance.adoc[]

.Example

[source,json]
----
"conformsTo": [
  "http://wis.wmo.int/spec/wcmp/2.0"
]
----

==== Properties / Type

The `+type+` property identifies the type of resource that the metadata record describes using values from [codelist]. While most metadata records will be set to `dataset`,
WCMP can also describe services and processes. See the resource type codelist footnote:[https://github.com/wmo-im/wcmp2-codelists/blob/main/codelists/resource-type.csv] for
allowed values.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_type.adoc[]

.Example

----
"properties": {
  ...
  "type": "dataset"
  ...
}
----

==== Properties / Title

The `+title+` property is a human-readable name of the dataset.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_title.adoc[]

.Example

[source,json]
----
"properties": {
  ...
  "title": "Surface weather observations"
  ...
}
----

==== Properties / Description

The `+description+` property is a free-text summary of the dataset.

.Example

include::../requirements/core/REQ_description.adoc[]

[source,json]
----
"properties": {
  ...
  "description": "Surface observations measured at the automatic and manual stations of the Environment and Climate Change Canada and partners networks, either for a single station or for the stations of specific provinces and territories (last 30 days)."
  ...
}
----

==== Properties / Keywords

The `+keywords+` property is a list keywords, tags, specific phrases, or classification codes associated with the dataset, but are not referenced to a particular vocabulary or knowledge organization system.

include::../recommendations/core/REC_keywords.adoc[]

.Example

[source,json]
----
"properties": {
  ...
  "keywords": [
    "surface",
    "observations",
    "weather",
    "real-time"
  ]
  ...
}
----

==== Properties / Themes

The `+themes+` property is a list of concepts that are referenced to a vocabulary or knowledge organization system used to classify the dataset.  A concept's `+id+`
provides an identifier for the given concept, as well as optional `+title`, `+description+` and `+url+` properties to further describe the concept as desired.

A theme's `+scheme+` property provides a remote reference to a controlled vocabulary, codelist or knowledge organization system.

A concept's optional `+url+` property can provide a remote reference to a given concept (for example, to an online ontology or code registry).

A WCMP metadata record can have one or more themes.

==== Geospatial and Temporal Extents

===== Geospatial Extent
The `+geometry+` property is the general bounding spatial extent of the dataset in the geographic coordinate system.  
Geospatial bounding
extents provide a useful indicator of the location of the dataset to facilitate search and map displays in the GDC.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_extent_geospatial.adoc[]
include::../recommendations/core/REC_extent_geospatial_point.adoc[]

            [-142.23, 28.03],
            [-142.23, 82.56],
            [-52.16, 82.56],
            [-52.16, 28.03],
            [-142.23, 28.03]
    ]]
}

----

===== Additional Geospatial Extents
The `+additionalExtents.spatial+` property is for other geospatial extents associated with the dataset, for example, non-geographic data or for describing multiple sub-areas of a dataset.
The `+additionalExtents.spatial.bbox+` property
provides the ability to list one to many minimum bounding geometries for a given dataset, where:

* minx is the westernmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in longitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -180 and 180, less than or equal to maxx.
* miny is the southernmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in latitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -90 and 90, less than or equal to maxy.
* maxx is the easternmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in longitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -180 and 180, greater than or equal to minx.
* maxy is the northernmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in latitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -90 and 90, greater than or equal to miny.

This property also facilitates catalogue searches with geospatial predicate (within extent, etc.).

}
----

[source,json]
----
"time": null
----

===== Additional Temporal Extents
The `+additionalExtents.temporal+` property is for describing other temporal extents associated with the dataset, for example, multiple time instances or to identify other temporal reference systems. 

Temporal extents can be fully bound or open in either direction (e.g., until or before).  An `+additionalExtents.temporal.resolution+`
property is able express the temporal granularity at which a given dataset's data is measured, generated, or reported.
