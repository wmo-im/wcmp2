== The WMO Core Metadata Profile Record

A WCMP record provides descriptive information about a dataset made available
through WIS 2.0.

=== Conformance Class Core

The WCMP Core Conformance Class provides requirements to articulate the required elements
of a WCMP discovery metadata record.

include::../requirements/requirements_class_core.adoc[]

==== Validation

The WCMP record schema is based on the schema defined as part of OGC API - Records - Part 1:
Core: Requirements Class: Record Core and the associated information model.  WCMP records which
are valid to WCMP are therefore valid to the OGC API - Records record schema.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_validation.adoc[]

==== Identifier

A WCMP record utilizes the OARec `+id+` property to provide a unique identifier
to a dataset collection.  A record identifier is essential for querying and identifying
records within the GDC.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_identifier.adoc[]

==== Conformance

A WCMP record leverages the OGC API `+conformsTo+` property to identify the conformance classes
that apply to the record.  WCMP conformance identification is valuable for content/version
detection and handling.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_conformance.adoc[]

==== Type

WCMP records provide descriptive information about a number of different resource types, such as
dataset or services.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_type.adoc[]

==== Title

A WCMP record's `+properties.title+` property is a human-readable name given to a given dataset collection.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_title.adoc[]

==== Description

A WCMP record has a `+properties.description+` property, which is a free-text summary description of the
resource the provider wishes to make discoverable.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_description.adoc[]

==== Keywords

A WCMP record can have has a `+properties.keywords+` property, typically represented using keywords, tags, key
phrases, or classification codes.

include::../recommendations/core/REC_keywords.adoc[]

==== Themes and Topic Hierarchy

A WCMP record has a `+properties.themes+` property, which is a knowledge organization system used to classify
the data that the record is describing.  A WCMP can have one or more themes.  The WIS Topic Hierarchy is put
forth as a specific theme/concept.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_themes_topic_hierarchy.adoc[]

==== Geospatial Extent

A WCMP record has a `+properties.extent.spatial.bbox+` item property, which provides the ability to list 1..n 
minimum bounding geometries for a given dataset collection, where:

* minx: westernmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in longitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -180 and 180, less than or equal to maxx
* miny: southernmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in latitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -90 and 90, less than or equal to maxy
* maxx: easternmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in longitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -180 and 180, greater than or equal to minx
* maxy: northernmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in latitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -90 and 90, greater than or equal to miny

This property also facilitates catalogue searches with spatial predicate (within extent, etc.).

include::../recommendations/core/REC_geospatial_extent-point.adoc[]
include::../recommendations/core/PER_geospatial_extent.adoc[]

==== Temporal Extent

A WCMP record has a `+properties.extent.temporal+` item property, which provides the ability to list 1..n
temporal extents as time instants or time periods.  Temporal extents can be fully bound or open in either direction
(e.g. until or before.  A temporal definition also includes resolution to be able express the granularity to
which a given dataset's data is measured/generated/reported.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_temporal_extent.adoc[]
include::../recommendations/core/REC_temporal_extent.adoc[]

==== Providers

A WCMP record can be one or more providers as part of the `+properties.providers+` property.  These elements
provide contact information based on the role of the provider.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_providers.adoc[]

=== Version

Datasets can typically be versioned by an organization (version of an NWP model, processing chain/workflow, etc.).  Data
providers may choose to make this information available to the user when providing multiple versions of a dataset
over time.

include::../recommendations/core/PER_version.adoc[]

=== Digital Object Identifier

A digital object identifier (DOI) is a persistent identifier or handle used to identify various objects uniquely,
and is widely in scientific publications.

include::../recommendations/core/PER_doi.adoc[]
include::../recommendations/core/REC_doi.adoc[]

=== Record Creation Date

A WCMP record has a `+properties.recordCreated+` property, which describes the date that the record was created.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_record_creation_date.adoc[]

=== Record Update Date

A WCMP record has a `+properties.recordUpdated+` property, which describes the date that the record was changed.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_record_update_date.adoc[]

=== Data Policy - License

Based on the WMO Unified Data Policy Resolution (Res.1) footnote:[https://ane4bf-datap1.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wmocms/s3fs-public/ckeditor/files/Cg-Ext2021-d04-1-WMO-UNIFIED-POLICY-FOR-THE-INTERNATIONAL-approved_en_0.pdf?4pv38FtU6R4fDNtwqOxjBCndLIfntWeR] (TODO: change to more permanent URL?), exchanged data
is expressed as `+core+` or `+recommended+`.  Additionally, `+other+` shall be used to accommodate other regulations
(e.g. ICAO Annex 3 – Meteorological Services for International Air Navigation). To avoid uncertainty, where there
are no limitations, the category `+NoLimitation+` can be used. (TODO: can this be license: null)?

[horizontal]
_Note_:: 
1. _Further information on the description of data policy is provided in the Guide to the WMO Information System (WMO-No. 1061) footnote:[https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=10257]
2. _The WIS 2.0 Global Cache will only cache data classified as `+core+`.  Data classified as `+recommended+` and `+other+` will
not be cached by the Global Cache.  They will be provided directly by WIS 2.0 Nodes, eventually having further conditions._

WMO data policy is considered to be a *legal constraint applying to both usage and access*.

If additional licenses apply, data providers can use the value `+various+`, and articulate the various
licenses in the `+links+` property.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_data_policy_license.adoc[]
include::../recommendations/core/REC_data_policy_license.adoc[]
include::../recommendations/core/PER_data_policy_license.adoc[]

=== Data Policy - Rights

A WCMP record has a `+properties.rights+` property, providing a statement that concerns all rights not addressed
by the license such as a copyright statement.

include::../recommendations/core/REC_data_policy_rights.adoc[]

=== Distribution Information

==== Overview

A WCMP record has to provide some information regarding how to access and retrieve the data products. This information is specified by the Distribution information and is defined as one of more links to the corresponding data access service. 

==== Examples

- *_Adding the MQTT information_*

Below is an example of the MQTT information added in the record:
