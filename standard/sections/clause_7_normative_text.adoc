==== WCMP record representation

WCMP record can be represented in various ways internally, in WIS systems and software tools, but its external representation is GeoJSON.

include::../recommendations/core/REC_media_type.adoc[]

==== Validation

The WCMP record schema is based on  _OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core: Requirements Class: Record Core_ schema and the associated information model.  WCMP records compliant with WCMP schema are therefore compliant with the _OGC API - Records_ record schema.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_validation.adoc[]

==== Identifier

The `+id+` property is a unique identifier
of the dataset.  A record identifier is essential for querying and identifying records within the GDC.

.Example

[source,json]
----
"id": "urn:wmo:md:ca-eccc-msc:observations.swob"
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_identifier.adoc[]
include::../recommendations/core/PER_identifier.adoc[]

==== Conformance

The `+conformsTo+` property to identifies the version of the WCMP standard that the metadata record conforms to. Conformance identification is valuable for version
detection and handling of content.

.Example

[source,json]
----
"conformsTo": [
  "http://wis.wmo.int/spec/wcmp/2/conf/core"
]
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_conformance.adoc[]

==== Properties / Type

The `+type+` property identifies the type of resource that the metadata record describes using values from the resource type codelist. While most metadata records will be set to `dataset`,
WCMP can also describe additional resources, such as services and processes.

A **dataset** is the primary granularity of a WCMP record describing a collection of data granules.

A **service** is an API or Web service providing a discovery, visualization, or access mechanism that operates on data.

A **process** is a workflow or execution to provide custom functionality to calculate a given output or product.

.Example:

[source,json]
----
"properties": {
  ...
  "type": "dataset"
  ...
}
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_type.adoc[]

==== Properties / Title

The `+title+` property is a human-readable name of the dataset.

.Example

[source,json]
----
"properties": {
  ...
  "title": "Surface weather observations"
  ...
}
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_title.adoc[]

==== Properties / Description

The `+description+` property is a free-text summary of the dataset.

.Example

[source,json]
----
"properties": {
  ...
  "description": "Surface observations measured at the automatic and manual stations of the Environment and Climate Change Canada and partners networks, either for a single station or for the stations of specific provinces and territories (last 30 days)."
  ...
}
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_description.adoc[]

==== Properties / Keywords

The `+keywords+` property is a list of keywords, tags or specific phrases associated with the resource, but are not referenced to a particular vocabulary or knowledge organization system.

.Example

[source,json]
----
"properties": {
  ...
  "keywords": [
    "surface",
    "observations",
    "weather",
    "real-time"
  ]
  ...
}
----

include::../recommendations/core/REC_keywords.adoc[]

==== Properties / Themes

The `+themes+` property is a list of concepts that are referenced to a vocabulary or knowledge organization system used to classify the resource.  

A theme's `+scheme+` property provides a remote reference to a controlled vocabulary, codelist or knowledge organization system.

A concept's `+id+` provides an identifier for the given concept, as well as optional `+title+`, `+description+` and `+url+` properties to further describe the concept as desired.

A concept's optional `+url+` property can provide a remote reference to a given concept (for example, to an online ontology or code registry).

A WCMP metadata record can have one or more themes.

.Examples

==== Geospatial and temporal extents

===== Geospatial extent

The `+geometry+` property is the general bounding spatial extent of the dataset in the geographic coordinate system.  
Geospatial bounding extents provide a useful indicator of the location of the dataset to facilitate search and map displays in the GDC.

.Examples

[source,json]
----
"geometry": {
  "type": "Polygon",
  "coordinates": [[
    [-142.23, 28.03],
    [-142.23, 82.56],
    [-52.16, 82.56],
    [-52.16, 28.03],
    [-142.23, 28.03]
  ]]
}
----

[source,json]
----
"geometry": {
  "type": "Point",
  "coordinates": [-79.38, 43.65]
}
----

[source,json]
----
"geometry": null
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_extent_geospatial.adoc[]
include::../recommendations/core/REC_extent_geospatial_point.adoc[]
include::../recommendations/core/REC_extent_geospatial_precision.adoc[]
include::../recommendations/core/REC_extent_geospatial_wis2_global_service.adoc[]

===== Additional geospatial extents

The `+additionalExtents.spatial+` property is for other geospatial extents associated with the dataset. For example, it may be useful for non-geographic data or for describing multiple sub-areas of a dataset.
The `+additionalExtents.spatial.bbox+` property
provides the ability to list one to many minimum bounding geometries for a given dataset, where:

* The minimum longitude is the westernmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in longitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -180 and 180, less than or equal to the maximum longitude.
* The minimum latitude is the southernmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in latitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -90 and 90, less than or equal to the maximum latitude.
* The maximum longitude is the easternmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in longitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -180 and 180, greater than or equal to the minimum longitude.
* The maximum latitude is the northernmost coordinate of the limit of the dataset extent, expressed in latitude decimal degrees as a
signed number between -90 and 90, greater than or equal to the minimum latitude.

This property also facilitates catalogue searches with geospatial predicate (within extent, etc.).

.Example

[source,json]
----
"additionalExtents": {
  "spatial": {
    "bbox": [
      [-142, 42, -52, 84]
    ],
    "crs": "http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84"
  }
}
----

include::../recommendations/core/PER_extent_geospatial.adoc[]

===== Temporal extent

The `+time+` property describes the general bounding extent of the dataset and the temporal resolution. 

Temporal extents provide a useful indicator of the date and time period of the dataset and facilitates temporal searching in the GDC. 

In addition the temporal resolution provides a useful indicator of the data update frequency (for example, for real-time datasets). If only times are given for the interval, it is implicitly assumed that those are recurring every day.

In cases where no time indication can be derived, it is applicable to state the value of `+null+`.

.Examples

[source,json]
----
"time": {
  "date": "2021-10-30"
}
----

[source,json]
----
"time": {
  "timestamp": "2021-10-30T11:11:11Z"
}
----

[source,json]
----
"time": {
  "interval" : ["2020-10-30", "2021-10-30"],
  "resolution": "P1D"
}
----

[source,json]
----
"time": {
  "interval" : ["T00Z", "T23Z"],
  "resolution": "PT1H"
}
----

[source,json]
----
"time": {
  "interval": ["2018-04-22", ".."],
}
----

[source,json]
----
"time": null
----

To ensure clarity, an additional human-readable explanation is given in the `+properties.description+`.
Further time-related characteristics (e.g. frequency of modifications, available data, etc.) should be added in `+properties.themes+`.

Some cases might be more complex due to the product's characteristics.
If necessary, further granularity can be indicated by the `+additionalExtents.temporal+` property (see <<_additional_temporal_extents>>).

.Example: Complex time indication

[source,json]
----
"time": {
  "interval" : ["2018-04-22", ".."]

include::../recommendations/core/REC_extent_temporal.adoc[]
include::../recommendations/core/PER_extent_temporal_service.adoc[]

===== Additional temporal extents

The `+additionalExtents.temporal+` property is for describing other temporal extents associated with the dataset. For example, it may be useful to represent multiple time instances or to identify other temporal reference systems. 
Temporal extents can be fully bound or open in either direction.  An `+additionalExtents.temporal.resolution+` property is able express the temporal granularity at which a given dataset's data is measured, generated, or reported.

.Example

[source,json]
----
"additionalExtents": {
  "temporal": {
    "interval": [
      [
        "T00Z",
        "PT180H"
      ],
      [
        "T12Z",
        "PT180H"
      ]
    ],

==== Links and distribution information [[links-distribution]]

===== Overview

The `+links+` property describes URLs and APIs for accessing the dataset or for subscribing to dataset notifications. Links are the primary mechanism for interacting with the data, and provide an "actionable" workflow to enhance and improve the user experience with "less clicks" for subscriptions and downloads.

The `+links+` property may also describe URLs for related documentation, related data, or visual images of the dataset.

The table below provides an overview of the properties of a link object.

.Link properties
|===
|Property|Requirement|Description

|``href``
|**required**
|The link destination or target, or URL

|``rel``
|optional
|The relationship that the link bears in the context of the WCMP record.  This is a controlled vocabulary defined
 by IANA link relationsfootnote:[https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml] or WCMP
 defined extensionsfootnote:[https://codes.wmo.int/wis/link-type] (see <<_link_relation_selection>>)

|``type``
|optional
|The media (or MIME) type of the format of the link

|``hreflang``
|optional
|The language of the content in the link

|``title``
|optional
|A human-readable name for the link (can be used for display on search / discovery web portals)

|``channel``
|**conditional**
|For data made available via MQTT, the topic to which a user may subscribe to for notifications and access

|``security``
|optional
|For access controlled data, a description of the access control mechanism applied (see <<_access_control>>)

|``distribution``
|optional
|Value added information about the link to further assist the user (additional document, typical file size, etc.) (see <<_distribution_information>>)

|===

For recommended data, the ``links`` property may also provide links to services that implement access control in support of authentication and authorization.  In secure data use cases, a user needs to be able to detect access-controlled data as part of data discovery and evaluation.

.Example a link object expressing access control using HTTP Basic Authentication for a given data access service

===== Templated links

Templated links allow for specifying a pattern of a link in support API interaction (where parameter values are variable).

.Example: a templated link object of a WMS service providing API access to images:

===== Distribution information

The `+distribution+` property provides information about the format of the dataset, associated documentation and representative examples of the dataset.

Additional distribution information is added to allow more comprehensive discovery services. Below is an example of such distribution information.

.Example with the complete distribution information

[source,json]

"links": [{
  "rel": "search",
  "type": "text/html",
  "title": "EUMETSAT Datastore",
  "href": "https://example.org/data/map/EO:EUM:DAT:MSG:MSG15-RSS",

===== Access control

WCMP record links may also provide links to services that implement access control in support of authentication and authorization.  In
secure data use cases, a user needs to be able to detect access controlled data as part of data discovery and evaluation.  The
example demonstrates how to express access control using HTTP Basic Authentication for a given data access service.

.Example

[source,json]
----
"links": [{
  "rel": "data",
  "type": "application/json",
  "title": "link to WAF endpoint",
  "href": "https://example.org/data/secure-data",
  "security": {
    "default": {
      "type": "http",
      "scheme": "basic",
      "description": "Please contact the data provider for accessing this secured resource."
    }
  }
}]

===== Link relation selection

Link relations are very important and provide valuable context to help clarify the semantics of a given link or URL.

The table below provides guidance on which link relation to use to identify common types of
links to data and services.

.Link relation selection
|===
|Link type|Link relation (`rel=`)

|Online data archive
|`archives`

|Online documentation
|`about`

|OpenAPI endpoint (e.g. JSON or YAML)
|`service-desc`

|OpenAPI endpoint in HTML (e.g. Swagger, ReDoc)
|`service-doc`

|OGC WMS, WFS, WCS, CSW, WPS Capabilities
|`service-desc`

|A single link providing numerous data granules
|`items`

|A link providing a single data granule
|`item`

|A link to numerous stations that the dataset is based on
|`stations`

|A link to a single station that the dataset is based on
|`station`

|citation
|`cite-as`

|A search portal or web application
|`search`

|A zipfile of data, or bulk download
|`enclosure`

|A browse graphic of a dataset
|`preview`

|An OGC API endpoint providing a collection description
|`collection`

==== Additional properties

A WCMP record can be extended as required for organizational purposes by adding properties (of any type) in the
record.  Additional properties do not break compliance to WCMP.

.Example

"properties": {
  ...
  "approvalStatus": "approved"
  "_comment": {
    "validationErrors": [
      "error 1",
      "error 2"
