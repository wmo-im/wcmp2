The data are collected continuously, day and night, over long time periods from sites around the world. Most MPLNET sites are co-located with sites in the NASA Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). MPLNET is also a contributing network to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) Aerosol Lidar Observation Network, GALION.",
