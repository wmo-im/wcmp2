== Overview

=== Purpose

This document is intended to define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in
support of the WMO Core Metadata Profile (WCMP). KPIs provide measurable
and valuable quality assessment rules over and above the rulesets put
forth by WCMP.

The core driver of WCMP KPIs is continuous improvement and useability of
discovery metadata as part of the WMO Information System (WIS).footnote:[https://community.wmo.int/activity-areas/wmo-information-system-wis]

=== Scope

This document is bound to the WCMP 2 specification and codelists. All
other metadata specifications or representations are not in scope.

=== Audience

The target stakeholder audiences for this document include (but are not limited to):

* Metadata providers (NCs, DCPCs)
* WIS2 Global Discovery Catalogues (GDCs)
* WIS2 Nodes
* GAW World Data Centres (WDCs)
* WIS2 Monitoring
* Metadata implementors (generation, ingest)

=== How to use

The KPIs in this document are designed to help metadata providers in the
curation of discovery metadata, as well as GDCs to measure the quality
of metadata from data providers.

In order to improve quality:

* providers should use the KPIs to build into their metadata generation
* WIS2 Global Services and consumers should use the KPIs in order to quality assess discovery metadata
  and provide subsequent feedback to providers

=== Scoring

Each KPI assesses a number of criteria asssociated with metadata quality,
resulting in a raw score, as well as a percentage. This approach supports
weighted rubric scoring.

=== Reference implementation

The TT-WISMD maintains pywcmpfootnote:[https://github.com/wmo-im/pywcmp], as the
reference WCMP validation utility which includes:

* validation against WMO Core Metadata Profile 2, Annex A: Conformance Class Abstract Test Suite (Normative)
* validation against the KPIs described in this document

Documentation on installation, configuration and usage can be found on the
pywcmp website.

pywcmp is provided as a resource to the community, under continuous
improvement. Contributions are welcome and can be facilited by the
WMO Task Team on WIS Metadata.
