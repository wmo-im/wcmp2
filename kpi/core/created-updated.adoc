=== Age of metadata record

==== WCMP Properties

* `properties.created`
* `properties.updated`

==== Rationale for measurement

WCMP2 metadata allows data publishers to express the date of when a record is created and/or updated.  Lifecycle management of WCMP2 content is key to ensuring accurate and up to date information as well as healthy links.

==== Measurement

The WCMP2 record includes both created and update dates with a recent date at the time of evaluation.

==== Guidance

WCMP2 records should be reviewed at least every 180 days as a best practice.
