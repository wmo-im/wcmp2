=== Links health

==== WCMP properties

Any property with linked information (URLs).

* `links[*].href`
* `properties.themes[*].concepts[*].url`
* `properties.themes[*].scheme`
* `properties.contacts[*].links[*].href`

==== Rationale for measurement

Broken links damage the user experience and gives the impression to users that a website is not maintained (88% of the online consumers are less likely to return to a site after a bad experiencefootnote:[https://review42.com/web-design-statistics]). In addition, having numerous broken links affects the reputation and rank of your website when indexed by mass market search engines.

HTTPS is increasingly becoming a requirement for numerous agencies as well as the suggested protocol vs. HTTP.  Having non-HTTPS links in a WCMP document often leads to mixed content errors in web applications deployed via HTTPS for example, and using AJAX/XHR design patterns. HTTPS supports secure, authoritative and trustworthy links as part of WIS Metadata.

==== Measurement

The number of broken links in each individual metadata record.  Broken links include links which, when accessed, result in a 4xx or 5xx HTTP error.footnote:[https://httpstatuses.com]

Also being measured is the use of HTTPS (with a valid SSL certificate) as the link protocol throughout WIS Metadata.

==== Guidance

Ensure that all links resolve and are accessible via HTTPS.
