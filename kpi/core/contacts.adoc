=== Contacts

Metadata records should contain information regarding the contact with the role `host` and how to contact them via email.

==== WCMP properties

* `$.properties.contacts[?(@.role=="host")]`
* `$.properties.contacts[?(@.role=="host")].emails`
* `$.properties.contacts[?(@.role=="host")].contactInstructions`

==== Rationale for measurement

Information of the host allows the user to contact the host in case of anything related to accessing the data.

==== Measurement

The presence of host information and supporting elements.

* host contact information (email, contact instructions)

==== Guidance

* Specify a host. Note that a host does not have to be the same as the main point of contact, principal investigator
* Specify an email for the host
* Specify contact instructions for the host
* Use ISO https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html[3166-1 alpha-3] codes to specify the `addresses.country` property.
