=== Guidance to score well on this assessment

==== WCMP 1.3 Part 1 Guidance

The description should provide a clear and concise statement that enables the
reader to understand the content of the dataset. For guidance when completing
the description, consider the following recommendations:

* State the 'things' that are recorded
* State the key aspects recorded about these things
* State what form the data takes
* State any other limiting information, such as time period of validity of the
  data
* Add purpose of data resource where relevant (e.g. for survey data)
* Aim to be understood by non-experts
* Do not include general background information
* Avoid jargon and unexplained abbreviations

==== Relevant recommendations

* Avoid adding a scientific descrtiption
* Limit information in the description to the specific resource that is being
  described
* Describe the contents of the resource and the key aspects and/or attributes
  that are represented
* Explain briefly what is unique about this resource and, if appropriate, how
  it differs from similar resources
* Avoid citing external sources to this resource
* Avoid spelling out commonly used acronym which are already understood by the
  general public
* Spell out uncommon acronyms only once
* Avoid including HTML/CSV tables, extra spaces or other markup to control
  display of text.  Use simple paragraph(s) only
* Avoid copying text from a journal article verbatim. This can lead to copyright
  violation concerns. Additionally, abstracts for journal articles are not
  intended to describe the provided resource and do not meet the metadata
  requirements. Related papers can be referenced from and/or tied to the
  metadata
* Avoid using future verb tense when possible. Write using present or past
  tenses
