== Good quality description

=== WCMP element(s)

* `properties.description`

=== What is being measured

The description shall not be too short or too long and contain no HTML markup. Spelling and grammar are correct. Bulletin templates should not be used to populate the description.

=== Rationale for measurement

The description faciliates ease of understanding and discovery and so is a key element of metadata information displayed as part of search results. Extensive and meaningful descriptive information allows for users to both understand and properly evaluate a metadata record and its respective resource in support of data access, visualization and exploitation.

In the context of WIS2 Global Discovery Catalogues, the product title and description are the two most relevant elements in the WCMP metadata record.

=== Guidance to score well on this assessment

The description should provide a clear and concise statement that enables the reader to understand the content of the dataset. For guidance when completing the description, consider the following:

==== Relevant recommendations

Aim to be understood by non-experts::
* Avoid adding a scientific description
Describe the contents of the resource and the key aspects and/or attributes that are represented::
* Limit information in the description to the specific resource that is being described, i.e. do not include general background information
* Explain briefly what is unique about this resource and, if appropriate, how it differs from similar resources
* State what form the data takes
* State any other limiting information, such as time period of validity of the data
Spell out uncommon acronyms only once::
* Avoid jargon and unexplained abbreviations
* Avoid spelling out commonly used acronym which are already understood by the general public
Write using present or past tenses::
* Avoid using future verb tense when possible
Use simple paragraph(s) only::
* Avoid including HTML/CSV tables, extra spaces or other markup to control display of text
Add purpose of data resource where relevant (e.g. for survey data)::
* Avoid citing external sources to this resource
* Avoid copying text from a journal article verbatim because this can lead to copyright violation concerns. Additionally, abstracts for journal articles are not intended to describe the provided resource and do not meet the metadata requirements. Related papers can be referenced from and/or tied to the metadata
